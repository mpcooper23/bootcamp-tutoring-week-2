// Problem #1 //
/**
 * 
 * Create a function called `logStudentInfo` that takes in one parameter - `array` - 
 * which represents an array of student objects like the array featured in data.js. 
 * This function should log each student's name, location and current course as shown 
 * in the example below. You must use the forEach method in your implementation.} 
 */


// Problem #2 //


// Problem #3 
//**Create a function called `filterByLocationAndCourses` that takes in two parameters - `array, location` - 
//`array` represents an array of student objects like the array featured in data.js; `location` represents 
//a string of a student's location. This function should use the native filter method to return a new array 
//of only the students whose location property matches the input location and who have at least 1 past course they have completed
//


// Problem #4 //
//**Create a function called `filterByBootcamp` that takes in one parameter - `array` - 
//which represents an array of student objects like the array featured in data.js. This 
//function should use the native filter method to return a new array of only the students 
//who have completed Bootcamp (if their current phase is Bootcamp, they have not completed the course yet).
 

// Problem #5 //
/**
 * Create a function called `mapCurrentCourses` that takes in one parameter - `array` - 
 * which represents an array of student objects like the array featured in data.js. 
 * This function should use the native map method to return a new array of strings of 
 * all every student's current course name and date as shown in the example below.
 */

// Problem #6 //
/*Create a function called `mapPastCourses` that takes in one parameter - `array` - 
which represents an array of student objects like the array featured in data.js. 
This function should use the native map method to return a new array of objects 
where each key is phase and the value at each key is the date as shown in the example below.
